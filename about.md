<p>Hi!<br/>
My name is Juan Antonio and I am a video game programmer. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I was a child I have loved everything about computers, technology and video games. My first video game console was a Sega Mega Drive II with some games such as Street of Rage 2, Alex kidd and Shinobi. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was 5 years old, the needed to play games in a PC, had me learn MS DOS. Years later, when I was about 11 years old, my passion for knowing how the games were made started and I began to doing some hack versions of Pok√©mon and from that moment on all the technological stuffs sparked my interest. <br/><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a real passion for AI videogames programming, in fact, when I play a video game I have a need to analyze how AI was programmed.</p>
