My first team work was doning 'World Wide Wreck', it is done using Unreal Engine 4 4.7v, the games is mostly made using C++.
I made some mechanics of main characters, all the enemies mechanics and the AI using behaviour trees, among other things.<br/><br/>

Here is the trailer of the game.<br/><br/>
